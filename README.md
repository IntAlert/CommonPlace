# CommonPlace
The CommonPlace app allows users to find events happening in their local area, as well as connect with others within the local community who share the same interests.

**Note:** This app is still under development so if you encounter any bugs, please let the Tech Team know!

## Getting Started

### Logging In
When you first launch CommonPlace, you have the option to log in using your Twitter credentials or to create an account if you do not have Twitter. If you do not have a Twitter account, click the "*New User*" button to go the the *Register* page where you may choose an email address and password to be associated with your account.

### The Map
Once you have set up your account and logged in, you will be taken to the *Map* page. You may be prompted to allow Location permissions and, upon doing so, the map will be centred around your position along with a search radius.
* __Navigating the map__ - Navigating the map is done by clicking and dragging. Zooming in/out is done by a 2 finger "pinch".
* __Adjusting search radius__ - To adjust the search radius, click the button in the top right of the screen to expand the navigation menu and then click the *Settings cog* icon. From there, just adjust the slider to your chosen search radius.
* __Event Summary__ - Events are shown on the map as a *marker*. To view a summary of the event, click the relevant marker. From here, you can easily see the details of the event, as well as when it is occurring, who to contact for more information and the website for the event (if applicable). There will also be 2 buttons in the event summary window. "*Interested*" will add the event to your personal event list and "*View Event Page*" takes you to the page for the event, where more information is available.
