## Getting Started

### Logging In / Logging Out
When you first launch CommonPlace, you have the option to log in using your Twitter credentials or to create an account if you do not have Twitter. If you do not have a Twitter account, click the "*New User*" button to go the the *Register* page where you may choose an email address and password to be associated with your account.
* Once logged in, the *Navigation Bar* will enable. This is how you get around in CommonPlace. To expand it, click the button in the top right of your screen.
* To log out, expand the *Navigation Bar* and then click the *Settings* cog icon. Then, click "*Logout*" and you will be returned to the login screen.

### Map
Once you have set up your account and logged in, you will be taken to the *Map* page. You may be prompted to allow Location permissions and, upon doing so, the map will be centred around your position along with a search radius.
* __Navigating the map__ - Navigating the map is done by clicking and dragging. Zooming in/out is done by a 2 finger "pinch".
* __Adjusting search radius__ - To adjust the search radius, expand the *Navigation Bar* and then click the *Settings* cog icon. From there, just adjust the slider to your chosen search radius.
* __Event Summary__ - Events are shown on the map as a *marker*. To view a summary of the event, click the relevant marker. From here, you can easily see the details of the event, as well as when it is occurring, who to contact for more information and the website for the event (if applicable). There will also be 2 buttons in the event summary window. "*Interested*" will add the event to your personal event list and "*View Event Page*" takes you to the page for the event, where more information is available.

### Profile
Navigating to the *Profile* page will present you with your personal CommonPlace profile. This is viewable by other users and allows them to see who you are, where you are based and your interests. Your following list is also viewable.
* __Editing your profile__ - To edit your profile, click the "*Edit*" button in the top left corner. You will then be given the option to edit/update your information.
* __Viewing users you have followed__ - On your profile, you can see a list of the users that you have chosen to follow using the *Discover* feature. Clicking on the profile picture of a user will take you to their profile page.
* __Events__ - Under your main profile is the *Events* list. This is only available to you and allows you to see all of the events you are interested in. For each event in your list, you are provided with a summary. You can then click the "*View Event Page*" button to be taken to the page for the event, where more information is available. There is also a "*Remove Event*" button, which will remove the event from your list.

### Create Event
The *Create Event* page allows users to host their own events within CommonPlace.
* __Event Name__ - This is the name of your event and should be short, clear and easy for users to understand.
* __Details__ - Any information that can not be put into the *Event Title* goes in this field. This can be any extra information such as food/drink availability, parking and cloakroom facilities.
* __Start Date__ - The start date of your event. Allows you to easily select the date using a pop-up datepicker.
* __End Date__ - The end date of your event. Allows you to easily select the date using a pop-up datepicker.
* __Website__ - The website/social media account that your event is linked to. This could be the official ticket reseller website or the Facebook page.
* __Contact email__ - The email address you would like users to contact you at. This will be embedded into your event page so that users can easily compose and send messages.
* __Image__ - This will open up a filepicker and allow you to select a relevant image for your event.

### Discover
The *Discover* feature allows you to connect with people in the local community that you share similar interests with and gives you the option to "follow" other users by swiping their profile.
* Swiping a profile to the **left** will dismiss a profile when you do not think that you share much in common with the other user.
* Swiping a profile to the **right** will add the user to your *following* list, which is available on your profile.
